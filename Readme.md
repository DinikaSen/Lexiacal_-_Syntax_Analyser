# Scanner and Parser Genaration

This is a lexical analyser genarated using flex and a sysntax analyser genarated using bison for the language (named C-) specified below.
  
The folder contains following files

  - lex.flex : lex input file with token definitions
  - parse.y : yacc file with grammar definitions
  - Makefile : to simplify compiling the lex/yacc application
  - input1.c : sample program written in the specified language (C-)
  - input2.c : sample program written in the specified language (C-)

Open a terminal inside the folder and run this command. This will create a executable file named 'program'

```sh
$ make
```

To run example programs (either input1.c or input2.c) with the executable, run this command

```sh
$ ./program<input1.c
```

### Lexical Conventions of C-
1. The keywords of the language are the following.
else, if, int, return, void, while
All keywords are reserved and must be written in lowercase.

2. Special symbols are as following.
    ```sh
    + - * / < <= > >= == != = ; , { } ( ) [ ] /* */
    ```
3. Other tokens are ID and NUM, defined by the following regular expressions.
ID = letter letter*
NUM = digit digit*
letter = a|..|z|A|..|Z
digit = 0|..|9
Lowercase and uppercase letters are distinct.

4. White space consists of blanks, newlines and tabs. White space is ignored except that it must separate IDs and NUMs and keywords.

5. Comments are surrounded by the usual C notations /* */. Comments can be placed anywhere white space can appear and comments cannot be placed within tokens.
Comments may include more than one line, but comments may not be nested.

### Syntax and Semantics of C-
1. program -> declaration-list
2. declaration-list -> declaration-list declaration | declaration
3. declaration -> var-declaration | fun-declaration
4. var-declaration-> type-specifier ID ; | type-specifier ID [ NUM ] ;
5. type-specifier-> int | void
6. fun-declaration-> type-specifier ID ( params ) compound-stmt
7. params-> param-list | VOID
8. param-list-> param-list , param| param
9. param-> type-specifier ID | type-specifier ID [ ]
10. compound-stmt-> { local-declarations statement-list }
11. local-declarations-> local-declarations var-declaration | empty
12. statement-list-> statement-list statement | empty
13. statement-> expression-stmt | compound-stmt | selection-stmt | iteration-stmt | return-stmt
14. expression-stmt-> expression ; | ;
15. selection-stmt-> if( expression ) statement | if( expression ) statement else
statement
16. iteration-stmt-> while ( expression ) statement
17. return-stmt-> return ; | return expression ;
18. expression-> var = expression | simple-expression
19. var-> ID | ID [ expression ]
20. simple-expression additive-expression
21. relop-> < | <= -> > additive-expression >= == relop !=
22. additive-expression-> additive-expression addop term
23. addop-> + | -
24. term-> term mulop factor | factor
25. mulop-> * | /
26. factor-> ( expression ) | var | call
27. call-> ID ( args )
28. args-> arg-list | empty
29. arg-list-> arg-list , expression | expression | NUM
